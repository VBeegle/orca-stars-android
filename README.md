	User Stories:

	1. Anise is a marine biologist. She loves marine life, and ever since
	she was little, Orcinus orca has been her favorite. She’s always 
	upset when she sees in the news that more animals have died from 
	eating or choking on plastic. She wants to take a stand and stop 
	supporting the companies that contribute to this, but she doesn’t 
	know of any nearby places that focus on sustainability to protect 
	animals like her beloved orcas. She wants an app that can tell her 
	what businesses around her location are dedicated to preserving the 
	environment.

	2. Logan is a highschool student whose highschool recently got 
	nominated by OrcaStars for their “Go Green” program. He wants to learn
	more about his local businesses, so that he can support the ones that 
	focus on sustainability. He doesn’t have the time to visit all of them 
	individually, either in person or on their website, to know if they 
	are part of OrcaStars. He wants to be able to easily search through 
	OrcaStars businesses, and learn what each one does for the environment 
	to preserve the orca population.
	
	3. Mike likes to visit the The Green Bean, a carbon-neutral café, but 
	wishes that he knew about more than just one “green” business. On his 
	most recent visit, he notices a flyer for “OrcaStars”, and that The 
	Green Bean is a member. He scans a QR code on the pamphlet, taking him 
	to the download page for the OrcaStars App. Wondering how a zero 
	emissions latté has a connection to orcas, he navigates to the “About” 
	section on the app. He scrolls through information about the Orca 
	Conservancy and the OrcaStars program, where his questions are answered 
	and then some. He is happy to have found such a good resource for 
	finding more establishments like The Green Bean.
